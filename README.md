# Project Description
This project involves a classification task to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the Bank Marketing dataset. The dataset has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains detailed information on client interactions during a marketing campaign.

The classification is implemented using two machine learning models: Neural Networks and Random Forest Classification. The project follows optimal strategies for preparing and preprocessing the dataset, ensuring robust and accurate model performance. Comprehensive details about the dataset, including meta information, class distribution, attributes, and attribute statistics, are available in the linked repository.

## Key steps in this project include:

Dataset preprocessing and preparation based on best practices.
Implementation of Neural Networks and Random Forest Classification models using appropriate libraries and frameworks.
Evaluation of model performance using optimal metrics.
A comparative analysis of the two models based on experimental results.
The experimental settings and outcomes for both models are documented to provide insights into their performance and effectiveness. This project demonstrates a practical approach to solving a real-world classification problem using machine learning.
